# Getting Started with Filter JOb Website UI

The "Filter Job" app for GitHub is a web application that allows users to search for job listings based on different filtering options. It fetches job data from the GitHub Jobs API and presents them in a user-friendly interface.

Key Features:

Job Filtering: The app provides various filter options, such as job type (Full-time, Part-time, Contract, Internship) and job categories (e.g., Software Engineer, Marketing, Data Analyst).

Responsive UI: The app is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

Pagination: The job listings are displayed in a paginated format, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages of job results.

Apply Links: Each job listing includes an "Apply Now" link that directs users to the corresponding job posting on GitHub.

Multiple Selection: Users can select multiple categories for filtering, making it easier to find jobs that match their interests.

Job Details: For each job, essential details are displayed, such as the position, location, company name, job type, and category.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
